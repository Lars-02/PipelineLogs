# Pipeline logs

All input files are in the `input/` folder. To add another one simply add a file.

I compiled the program within WSL using make.

To compile go to this folder and run the following.

```shell
cmake ./
```

```shell
make
```

Then there will be a binary called `pipeline_logs`.

You can run this by executing this:

```shell
./pipeline_logs
```
